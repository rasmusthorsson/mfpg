        A simple example of how to use MFPG
      </div>
      <div class="guidepage-text">
        <h1>Example -- Easy</h1>
        <p>
          In this tutorial we show a simple example of how to use <b>MFPG</b> via the
          <b>GUI</b>. If the <b>CLI</b> is the preferable interface, then this
          tutorial should still be applicable, with the only changes being how the
          different options are selected. For an overview on how these options are
          selected, see the <a href="/guides/guiguide">GUI Guide</a> or the
          <a href="/guides/cliguide/">CLI Guide</a> respectively.
          <br><br>
          For this example we will need three different files, the music
          score in the form of a <b>musicXML</b> file (a file format most notation
          programs allow as export formats), the <b>MFPG DSL</b> file, and a
          <b>CSV Notemapper</b> file. These files and their purpose will be explained
          in their respective sections, and in this tutorial we will be using premade
          files taken from the 
          <a href="https://github.com/rasmusthorsson/mfpg">GitHub repo</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Configurations</h2>
        <p>
          When you start the <b>MFPG GUI</b> it looks for a file called
          <i>.mfpg_configs.xml</i> in the current directory. Most likely, this file
          is not present when you first run the program, and you will be asked whether
          you want to create this file in the current directory. This file contains
          information about stored <i>configurations</i>. a configuration is a 
          selection of <b>GUI</b> settings, such as which output file is used or
          whether the <b>DSL</b> or <b>Presets</b> is used as 
          <i>Instrument Settings</i>. 
          Almost any setting you can set in the <b>GUI</b> can be stored in a 
          configuration. The purpose if this is to simplify usage when the <b>GUI</b>
          is restarted or when different configurations are desired depending on
          situation. 
          <br><br>
          New configurations can be temporarily created in the program
          by using the <i>configs</i> menu at the top of the window, and selected
          in the dropdown bar underneath. Note that creating a new configuration 
          does <i>not</i> create a new <i>stored</i> configuration, and any new
          configuration that is not stored will be deleted when the program is closed.
          If no <i>.mfpg_configs.xml</i> file is found then storing and loading of
          configurations is disabled. Temporary configurations can be removed by using
          the <i>Remove Config</i> button underneath the configuration selection.
          However, we will not be working with configurations in this tutorial. 
        </p>
        <h2>Notemapper</h2> 
        <p>
          Next we will discuss the <b>Notemapper</b>. The <b>Notemapper</b> is
          a necessary user-defined component of the program which dictates all
          physical <i>ways</i> to play each note on an instrument. This means that
          the <b>Notemapper</b> will specify things like:
          <br><br>
          The <b>A 4</b> Note can be played on the <b>D-String</b> using 
          <b>Finger 2</b> in <b>Hand Position 3</b>
          <br><br>
          However, since almost all notes can be played in multiple different 
          <i>ways</i>, the same <b>Notemapper</b> would also specify:
          <br><br>
          The <b>A 4</b> Note can be played on the <b>A-String</b> using 
          <b>Finger 0</b> in <b>Hand Position 0</b>
          <br><br>
          (Which specifies that <b>A 4</b> can be played on the open <b>A-String</b>)
          <br>
          This is repeated until all <i>ways</i> to play <i>all</i> playable notes
          have been specified. There is no restriction on whether some of the values
          are repeated in different specifications, the same <b>Notemapper</b> could
          also say:
          <br><br>
          The <b>A 4</b> Note can be played on the <b>D-String</b> using 
          <b>Finger 3</b> in <b>Hand Position 2</b>
          <br><br>
          The <b>Notemapper</b> will therefore limit which <i>physical attributes</i>
          can be used in the <b>MFPG DSL</b> (see next section). In these examples, 
          the <i>physical attributes</i> are <b>String</b>, <b>Finger</b>, and <b>
          Hand Position</b>. These are the only attributes available in the premade
          <b>Notemapper</b> we are going to use. 
          <br><br>
          To select this <b>Notemapper</b> we will first need to download the CSV
          file from the <a href="https://github.com/rasmusthorsson/mfpg">Github
          repo</a> found under the <i>'resources/dsl_files/'</i> directory called
          <b>BasicNoteMapper.csv</b>. Alternatively, it can be downloaded by clicking
          <a href="/files/BasicNoteMapper.csv" target="_blank">here</a>. This file is
          then used in the <b>GUI</b> by selecting <b>CSV Notemapper</b> under 
          <i>Notemapper Settings</i>, and then selecting the file in the file selector
          <i>CSV File</i> underneath.
        </p>
        <h2>Instrument and Actionset</h2>
        <p>
          For this section we will be using the <b>MFPG DSL</b>. In order for the
          program know which notes can be played on which strings of the instrument, 
          it must be told the specifics of the instrument by the user. We must also
          define what is called an <b>Actionset</b> which will contain the
          preferences of the user when it comes to deciding which fingering position
          is superior when there is a choice between multiple fingering positions when
          playing a note. We are going to start with a premade <b>MFPG DSL</b> file
          and make some adjustments. In order to get an understanding on how the 
          <b>MFPG DSL</b> files are written and the syntax of the <b>DSL</b> you
          should read the <a href="/guides/dslguide">DSL Guide</a>.
          <br><br>
          The <b>MFPG DSL</b> file we will use contains a very basic actionset, 
          the file can be found in the 
          <a href="https://github.com/rasmusthorsson/mfpg">GitHub repo</a> in the
          <i>'resources/dsl_files/'</i> directory named 
          <b>DSL_test_configuration_1.mfpg
          </b> or be downloaded <a href="/files/BasicDSL.mfpg" target="_blank">here
          </a>. Once the file
          has been downloaded the file can be selected by switching the <i>
          Instrument Settings</i> to <b>DSL File</b> and then selecting the file
          in the file selector underneath. Before we make any modifications or 
          considerations of the <b>MFPG DSL</b> file, let us set up the rest of the
          settings to make it easier to test the modifications we make later on.
        </p>
        <h2>Score selection and other tidbits</h2>
        <p>
        We will be using a test case from the 
        <a href="https://github.com/rasmusthorsson/mfpg">GitHub repo</a> found in the
        directory <i>'tests/cases/'</i>, we will use the <b>A_W.xml</b> test case (
        which can also be downloaded directly 
        <a href="/files/A_W.xml" target="_blank">here</a>.).
        This file can then be selected as a target using the <i>file</i> menu at the
        top of the window. 
        <br><br>
        We also have the option of selecting the solver. This option is likely to be
        moved to some hidden advanced section as there is effectively no reason to
        use any solver but the shortest path one currently, so that is the one we will
        use. The two optimization checkboxes should also be used, as they improve 
        performance of the solver.
        <br><br>
        Next, we can select whether we want the output to be written to a file or 
        just written directly to the <i>Output</i> tab in the <i>files</i> window
        in the middle. If a file is selected the file will instead be shown in the
        <i>Output</i> tab. We will not select an output file for this example.
        Finally, we can also select the type of output we want to see, currently only
        two options are available, a CSV output (<i>comma-separated values</i>) or a
        direct output. The direct output is easier to read for a human, so we will
        select that.
        </p>
        <h2>The current state of the DSL file</h2>
        Here is an image of how the program looks like with the current selection.
        <p align="left">
            <img width="600px" height="500px" style="border:2px solid #737373" src="../images/example-easy-selection.png">
        </p>
        <p>
        Now we can start considering the <b>DSL</b> relative to our preferences. We 
        can see
        the <b>DSL</b> file by selecting the <i>DSL</i> tab in the <i>files</i> 
        window, where we can then make changes to the file. Note that no changes are
        made until the file is saved using the buttons at the bottom of the <i>files
        </i> window. Alternatively, this file can be modified using any text-editor
        of your choice if you find it easier to do so, but then you must re-select
        the file using the <b>DSL</b> filepicker after making any changes.
        <br><br>
        <i>Section is subject to change as the base DSL changes over time</i>
        <br><br>
        The first three parts of the <b>DSL</b> file are parts which we will not 
        modify: 
        <ul>
          <li>The output of each action is an integer, the alternative would have it
              be a double which is not something we are likely to need.
          <li>The attribute 
            declarations specify which attributes may be used in the actions section, 
            we do not want to remove any of these, and cannot add any new since any 
            new additions must also be part of the <b>Notemapper</b>.</li>
          <li>The instrument declaration, this describes which notes belong to
            which strings on the instrument. Since the <b>Notemapper</b> only supports
            the violin currently, we can not add any new notes here. We are also not
            interested in excluding any existing notes either.</li>
        </ul>
        The <b>DSL</b> file also contains this set of rules:
        <ul>
          <li>Two rules which define rests, one for going <i>from</i> a rest and one 
              for going <i>to</i> a rest. This allows us to disable all other actions
              if a rest occurs, since we do not need to apply any cost if coming from
              or going to a rest. </li>
          <li>We then have three rules, one for each of the three attributes, that
              simply describe applying a cost equivalent to the distance between
              the values of the two attributes across a transition.</li>
          <li>Finally we have a specific rule for the <b>String</b> attribute which
              states that if the difference between <b>String</b> values is greater 
              than 1, the cost should be 100. This is done as crossing a string without
              playing it is something to be avoided at any cost generally</li>
        </ul>  
        Finally there is a dependencies part which have a set of rules meant to
        achieve two things:
        <ul>
          <li>The first eight statements ensure that if the transition is from or
              to a rest, no other actions are considered. This means there is no cost
              associated with transitioning from or to a rest.</li>
          <li>The last statement defines that if we have a transition that crosses
              more than 1 string, we disable the 'regular' string action and only run
              the 'expensive' string action.
        </ul>
        From these definitions, we can surely make a few improvements and additions to
        build a more effective and accurate actionset.

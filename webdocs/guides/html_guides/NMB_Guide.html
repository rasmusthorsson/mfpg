<h1>CSV Note Mapper File Generator</h1>
<p>This minor program is meant to help with generation of CSV Note Mapper files. </p>
<p><strong>The Builder.cpp</strong> file contains an example notemapper that defines the <strong>BasicNoteMapper</strong> as a CSV file. 
This CSV file can then be used with the <em>&quot;--notemapper=FILENAME&quot;</em> flag for the MFPG program to use notes 
defined there as the notemapper. There is a custom function that can be used to define a custom notemapper 
in the <strong>Builder.cpp</strong> file. </p>
<p>To define a custom notemapper, define it in the <strong>Builder.cpp</strong> file in the <em>build_file_CUSTOM</em> function, 
then uncomment the <em>#define CUSTOM</em> comment at the start of the <strong>Builder.h</strong> file.</p>
<p>The program is compiled using the <strong>make</strong> command in the terminal, and the program is then used by
running it with a file name where the output is to be written. If no output is given then the program
defaults to outputting to <em>CSV_Map.csv</em>.</p>

        General Features

      <h3 align="center">
        Note History
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        It would be useful to be able to refer to a history of recent notes in some cases, one can imagine
        an action where the previous two notes are checked for their duration before deciding on an action.
        This history would likely be limited to 3-5 notes, and could possibly also extend into the future
        so that future notes could be checked.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">
         Additional CSV Notemapper Attributes/Files
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        There are only 3 attributes for the violin CSV Notemapper currently, this can be expanded to 5-7
        to get more usable attributes for users who do not want to define their own notemapper. There
        is also only a notemapper for the violin currently, other instruments will need their own 
        notemappers.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">
        Tool for CSV Notemapper generation
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The way to build your own CSV Notemapper files currently involves writing your own code to do so. 
        This is not a long term solution and in the future a tool which is easier to use should be developed
        for this purpose. It is currently not clear how this tool might look, but it should be intuitive
        and usable for people with little to no programming experience.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">
        Improved Output
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        The output is currently given as either a direct output which a direct representation of the 
        solution in the code. The other option is outputting a CSV file. None of these are easy to parse 
        for a human and ideally a readable output option should be added. This could be done by taking the
        CSV output and using it to construct an output overlayed on the original score to specify hand 
        positions for example.

        GUI Features

      <h3 align="center">
        DSL Menu selections
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Rather than having to write out most parts of the DSL there could be a menu selection of those parts.
        This would be for selections with limits, such as which action type is used, or which attribute
        is used in actions (the attributes themselves would be typed in the attributes part, but then the
        selection would give you a list of pre-defined attributes.).
      </p>
      <h1>
        DSL Features
      </h1>
      <h3 align="center">
        DSL Typechecker
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Any errors or mistakes in writing the DSL will only be found at runtime, and these errors can be 
        difficult to locate with the exception messages alone. A typechecker for the DSL should be
        developed to check the code in the DSL file window in the GUI, and possibly with an option in the
        CLI to check that the DSL is without errors.

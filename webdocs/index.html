        <h2>MFPG</h2>
      <div class="homemenu-p"> 
        <b>MFPG</b> (<i>Music Fingering Position Generator</i>) is a tool for 
        automatically determining the sequence of fingering positions for a piece of
        music for a bowed string instrument. When a sequence of fingering positions 
        is developed for a piece of music, it is almost always done individually by 
        the musician who is going to play it. While there are a few suggested 
        guidelines for this process, it is generally a personalized process where 
        many personal preferences come into play. 
        <br><br>
        The problem itself arises from the fact that for many bowed string 
        instruments there is an overlap across strings. A lot of notes can be played 
        on several different strings. Therefore, when playing a note, the musician 
        must select what string to play that note on. To make matters worse, since
        the position of the hand when playing a note on a string can vary, along with
        which finger is used to play said note, further choices need to be made about
        <i>how</i> to play that note. 
        <br><br>
        <b>MFPG</b> solves this problem by allowing the user to define their 
        preferences for developing a sequence of fingering positions, and then
        does the work of developing that sequence for them.
      </div>
        <h2>Why MFPG?</h2>
      <div class="homemenu-p"> 
        As the previous section states, <b>MFPG</b> takes the preferences of a user
        and generates the sequence of fingering positions for them. But why could the
        user not just do this themselves? The answer can be found when looking at the
        problem from a more mathematical viewpoint. The issue of developing a 
        sequence of fingering positions can be simplified into the graph problem
        of finding the shortest path through a layered weighted 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>.
        While there are a few good solutions to this problem from an algorithmic
        perspective, such as using 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
          Topological Sorting
        </a>.
        <br><br>
        However, this is not how anyone who is figuring out a sequence for fingering 
        positions actually calculates the sequence. This is instead generally done
        using some form of a <i>greedy</i> algorithm, an algorithm that effectively
        only concerns itself with the near future and does not consider the far 
        reaching consequences further along the music piece. This can either lead to
        having to redo the process if certain sequences are found to lead to 
        <i>deadends</i> (where the musician reaches a hand position on a string from
        where they have no <b>acceptable</b> way to reach the next note), or a
        suboptimal sequence where smaller 'acceptable' concessions have to be made.
        <br><br>
        <b>MFPG</b> assists in finding the <i>best</i> sequence by instead running
        a shortest path algorithm on a constructed graph based on the music piece
        and the preferences specified by the user. This should then find candidates
        of sequences which fit the users preferences, without those earlier mentioned
        'acceptable' concessions. Even if a musician were to learn to use a short 
        path algorithm to solve this problem, it would still take far longer and be 
        far more tedious than letting a computer do it, since the preferences are 
        usually well defined. 
      </div>
        <h2>MFPG Interfaces</h2>
      <div class="homemenu-p"> 
      There are two interfaces for using <b>MFPG</b>: The <b>CLI</b> (<i>command-line 
      interface</i>) and the <b>GUI</b> (<i>graphical user interface</i>). The
      <b>CLI</b> a text-based interface (currently only tested using bash), while the
      <b>GUI</b> is a graphical interface and probably the preferred interface in
      most cases. 
      </div>
        <h2>Using MFPG</h2>
      <div class="homemenu-p"> 
      For general usage, <b>MFPG</b> should be used using the <b>MFPG DSL</b> 
      (<i>Domain-specific Language</i>) which is intended as a <i>relatively</i> 
      simple way to descibe the preferences of the musician. There is a specific page 
      with a <a href="/guides/dslguide/">guide</a> on how to write <b>MFPG DSL</b> 
      files. This should also generally be used in conjunction with a 
      <b>CSV Notemapper</b> (<i>comma-separated value Notemapper</i>) file. 
      <br><br>
      The <b>CSV Notemapper</b> file
      is trickier to construct than the <b>MFPG DSL</b> file. It contains all the 
      information about the physical attributes of all playable notes. This means
      that for every playable note for a specific instrument, the <b>CSV</b> file
      contains all <i>ways</i> to play that note. An example on using these the 
      <b>DSL</b> and the <b>CSV Notemapper</b> can be found 
      <a href="#">here</a>. TODO FIX THIS

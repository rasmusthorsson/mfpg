# Usage

The files here are generated by the _bnfc_ tool. Some files generated by _bnfc_ have
been removed as they are not needed by the program. All files can however be 
regenerated using the Makefile if needed. The Makefile has a few targets:

__make clean__ removes all unnecessary files, these are object files and files needed
for generating the necessary files.

__make distclean__ removes _all_ generated files.

__make bnfc__ generates the _bnfc_ files. Most of these files are intermediate files
which will be used for necessary files.

__make__ generates all necessary files, along with object files and a test parser 
which can be used to parse using the syntax.

In order to regenerate the syntax:

_make distclean_
_make bnfc_
_make_
_make clean_

The makefile also appends some lines of code to the __Lexer.C__ file in order to
facilitate windows compatability.

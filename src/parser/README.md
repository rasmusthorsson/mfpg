# DSL for MFPG input handling.

## BNFC
The files here were generated by BNFC (except for the mfpg\_dsl.cf file), with the skeleton file being 
modified to transform the input DSL file into structures used by the program.

## Files
The naming conventions of the files in this directory are determined by the BNFC generator, only the files
needed are kept as active files, the Makefile in this directory allows for full BNFC generation but should
only be used for testing purposes.

## Usage
The DSL is built and linked with the main program using cmake and does not need to be built using the 
Makefile in this directory. If the DSL needs to be updated then the Makefile can be used to generate
new necessary files.

## Targets
__make distclean__ cleans the entire directory for distribution of the DSL, __make clean__ cleans the 
directory to the point where only the files required by MFPG remain. __make bnfc__ builds the BNFC files, 
__make__ builds some necessary files and some unnecessary files, but also builds an executable for testing
that a DSL file can be parsed. In order to rebuild the directory:

make bnfc
make
make clean

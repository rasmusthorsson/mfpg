# Music Fingering Position Generator

A private project to build software to automically construct a fingering position sequence for a given
music score (for a single bowed string instrument). By using user input into preferences and 
instrument definitions the software should be able to more accurately give a good base of
fingering positions when fed a sheet music MusicXML file. Uses the mx library (found at
https://github.com/webern/mx) for MusicXML parsing.
